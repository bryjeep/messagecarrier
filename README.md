# MessageCarrier, Smartphone Message Relay System for Emergency Situations

MessageCarrier was the winning project for the 2011 Random Hacks of Kindess hackathon in Atlanta.

## The Team:
- Server Magic: Brad Beglin & Michael Ivey
- Mobile Team: Blake Byrnes, Joey Gibson & Bryan Davidson

## Platforms
- Android (wishlist)
- Iphone

## Network Map
- Cell phones communicate any one message amongst dynamically discovered peers on a bluetooth network.
- When the first of the cell phones has an external connection (WAN) it sends messages to the central server
- The central servers send data via messaging systems (Twilio for SMS, twitter, etc) and ensure that the data is only sent once
